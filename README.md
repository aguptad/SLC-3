# SLC-3

Designed a simple microprocessor using SystemVerilog. It is a modified subset of the LC-3, consisting of a 16-bit processor with a 16-bit program counter, a 16-bit instruction register, and 16-bit general-purpose registers. This microprocessor is capable of performing a wide range of operations, offering 11 possible opcodes for the user to utilize. These operations include various logical operations, memory writing and loading, as well as the ability to modify the program counter. With these opcodes, users can create subroutines that can be stored in memory. These subroutines can then be used for larger programs such as multiplication, sorting, counting, and various other tasks.
